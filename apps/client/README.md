## IMPROVEMENTS

### Set a theme

### Lazy loading on pages

### Set separated stores for messages, users and tasks

### Create a monorepo structure and run server on a separated application using yarn workspaces and CRACO

## ADDED LIBRARIES

### TYPESCRIPT

#### Typing makes the aplication safer and easier to read.

### ZUSTAND

#### I choose zustand for state management because it is super easy to configure, it´s fast, keep all the stores on a hook structure and it is possible to isolate the store, using the tell don´t ask way of providing the information for the aplication

### STYLED COMPONENTS

#### Styled components is the best way to create reusable and customizable components, it´s not the best option in terms of performance but is very handy in term of creating reusable code

### React DND

#### I had experience on doing drag and drop features in other projects and from the libs I testes the DND was the only one that worked on mobile screens and it´s very easy to use.

## HOW TO RUN

### same way.

### Notes

#### I was planning to do the chat too, but as the test was made to be built in 4 hours and as I did it using typescript and styled components (which takes more time) I didn´t made the chat and didn´t focused on layout things.
